# Welcome!

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of California, Riverside, with six years of research experience ranging from empirical studies during my master's program to advanced work in machine learning and econometric theory during my doctorate. 

My research has reinforced my strong belief that integrating machine learning with econometric theory will transform the research paradigm in causal inference, providing empirical researchers with powerful tools to explore causal relationships more intelligently and effectively.

I am excited to announce that I am entering the job market and welcome any opportunities to connect! Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:yding067@ucr.edu) or connect with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/yifei-ding-4929251b0) if you're interested.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on Machine Learning(Prediction and Causal Inference), Econometrics Theory, Applied Econometrics. The primary machinery is dynamic optimization, game theory, mechanism design and information design.
